This WYSIWYG markdown editor is built and modified on top of [@laobubu](https://github.com/laobubu)'s awesome project [HyperMD](https://github.com/laobubu/HyperMD).

We might migrate to [codemirror 6](https://codemirror.net/6/) in the future, which would be a completely rewrite.
But for now, we will just stick to the current [codemirror 5](https://codemirror.net) codebase.
